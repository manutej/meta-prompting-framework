## Extraction Synthesis

The v2 framework has achieved deep mathematical sophistication but lacks:

1. **Consciousness**: Bridge to phenomenology
2. **Life**: Biological computation
3. **Cosmos**: Universal computation
4. **Meaning**: Semantic emergence
5. **Purpose**: Teleological direction

These gaps point toward a framework that transcends computation to become a theory of everything—mathematical, physical, biological, and conscious.

The v3 framework must integrate:
- Consciousness as fundamental
- Life as computational process
- Universe as living category
- Meaning as emergent property
- Love as binding force

This represents the transition from framework as tool to framework as universal theory.
