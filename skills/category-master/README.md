## 🎓 How to Use the category-master Skill

### Core Capabilities

The skill excels at:

1. **Proving Universal Properties**
   - Use when: Establishing limits, colimits, adjunctions, or representability

   - Example: "Prove that products are limits of discrete diagrams"

2. **Verifying Coherence Conditions**
   - Use when: Working with monoidal categories, bicategories, or operads

   - Example: "Verify the coherence axioms for this symmetric monoidal structure"

3. **Diagram Chasing**

   - Provides: Systematic techniques and universal property applications
   - Example: "Show this diagram commutes using the universal property of pullbacks"

4. **Categorical Constructions**
   - Use when: Building comma categories, Kan extensions, or slice categories
   - Provides: Definitions, formulas, and verification procedures
   - Example: "Construct the left Kan extension of F along K"

5. **Size Considerations**
   - Use when: Dealing with large categories, functor categories, or Yoneda
   - Provides: Grothendieck universe framework, local smallness checks
   - Example: "Is this functor category well-defined given the size of these categories?"

6. **Adjunction Verification**
   - Use when: Proving or using adjoint functors
   - Provides: Both unit-counit and hom-bijection methods with componentwise details
   - Example: "Prove Free ⊣ Forgetful using the unit-counit characterization"

7. **Topos Theory**
   - Use when: Working with elementary or Grothendieck toposes
   - Provides: Correct definition, subobject classifier, internal logic
   - Example: "Verify this category is an elementary topos"

8. **Higher Category Theory**
   - Use when: Working with bicategories, ∞-categories, or coherence
   - Provides: Pasting diagrams, strictification theorems, coherence principles
   - Example: "Verify the pentagon axiom for this bicategory"

9. **Operadic Structures**
   - Use when: Using operads in algebra or homotopy theory
   - Provides: Both symmetric and non-symmetric operads, algebras over operads
   - Example: "Define an A_∞-algebra structure using the associative operad"

### Typical Workflows

#### Workflow 1: Proving a Theorem
```
1. State theorem precisely with size conditions
2. Identify relevant universal properties
3. Draw necessary commutative diagrams
4. Apply verification templates from skill
5. Check all coherence conditions componentwise
6. Verify size considerations
```

**Example Query**: "Prove that right adjoints preserve limits. Use the category-master skill to provide a rigorous proof with all universal properties made explicit."

#### Workflow 2: Constructing a Framework
```
1. Define objects and morphisms with size specs
2. Verify category axioms
3. Identify universal constructions
4. Check functoriality (preserve id, composition)
5. Verify naturality (commutative squares)
6. Establish coherence for higher structures
```

**Example Query**: "I'm constructing a bicategory of spans. Use category-master to guide me through verifying all the bicategory axioms, especially the pentagon and triangle coherence."

#### Workflow 3: Technical Verification
```
1. Check componentwise structure (not functor-level)
2. Verify size conditions (locally small? small?)
3. Confirm coherence at each dimension
4. Apply duality where appropriate
5. Use Yoneda for representability
```

**Example Query**: "I need to verify that this adjunction satisfies the triangle identities. Use category-master to ensure I'm checking them componentwise correctly."

### Best Practices

**DO:**
- ✓ Request verification templates for systematic checking
- ✓ Ask for explicit diagrams when proving commutativity
- ✓ Reference specific theorems by name (Mac Lane coherence, Yoneda lemma, etc.)
- ✓ Request componentwise verification for adjunctions and natural transformations
- ✓ Ask about size conditions when they might matter
- ✓ Use the skill for rigorous proofs, not informal explanations

**DON'T:**
- ✗ Use for computational category theory (this is theoretical)
- ✗ Ask for code implementations (unless formal verification)
- ✗ Expect intuitive explanations over formal definitions
- ✗ Skip size checks when working with large categories
- ✗ Confuse functor-level notation with componentwise structure

### Example Prompts

**Good Prompts** (leverage the skill effectively):

1. "Using category-master, prove that the forgetful functor U: Grp → Set has a left adjoint (the free group functor). Verify all triangle identities componentwise."

2. "I'm working with a symmetric monoidal category. Use category-master to help me verify the pentagon and hexagon axioms for the coherence isomorphisms."

3. "Apply category-master to show that the category of finite sets FinSet is NOT a topos, using the subobject classifier requirement."

4. "I need to verify that this functor preserves limits. Use category-master to provide the universal property argument with explicit diagrams."

5. "Using category-master, explain when I should use a symmetric operad versus a non-symmetric operad, with examples from homotopy theory."

6. "Help me verify that this weak 3-category cannot be strictified. Use category-master's discussion of Simpson's conjecture."

**Poor Prompts** (don't leverage the skill properly):

1. "What is category theory?" (too basic, use introductory texts)

2. "Write me Haskell code for functors" (computational, not theoretical)

3. "Explain adjunctions intuitively" (skill is for rigor, not intuition)

4. "Is there a category of all categories?" (size paradox, but ask about universes)

### Integration with Other Skills

**Combine category-master with:**

- **Formal verification tools**: Use skill for proof strategy, tools for checking
- **Computer algebra systems**: Use skill for theory, CAS for computation
- **LaTeX/proof assistants**: Use skill for mathematical content, tools for formatting
- **Domain-specific skills**: Use category-master for categorical foundations, other skills for applications

### Skill Limitations

**This skill does NOT:**
- Perform computations in specific categories (e.g., computing tensor products)
- Generate code implementations (unless for formal proof systems)
- Provide historical context or motivation (focuses on rigorous math)
- Cover applications to programming, physics, etc. (pure mathematics focus)
- Replace human intuition or creativity in research

**This skill DOES:**
- Provide rigorous definitions and theorems
- Offer verification templates and proof strategies  
- Ensure mathematical correctness at PhD level
- Cover foundational to advanced topics comprehensively
- Flag common errors and misconceptions
