# MARS + MERCURIO Curriculum Evaluation Report
## Brutal Honest Assessment with Recursive Improvement Cycles

**Curriculum Under Review:** AI Literacy for High School Students (Summer Intensive)
**Evaluation Framework:** MARS (Systems-Level) + MERCURIO (Three-Plane Convergence)
**Version:** Iteration 1 → Target: Iteration 3 (minimum quality threshold)

---

## MERCURIO THREE-PLANE ANALYSIS

### MENTAL PLANE (Truth/Intellectual Rigor)

#### Strengths
- ✅ UNESCO AI Competency Framework alignment is legitimate
- ✅ Research citations are current (2025 sources)
- ✅ Gen Z attention span research is accurate (8-second finding from Frontiers)
- ✅ Microlearning effectiveness claims are backed by systematic review

#### BRUTAL HONESTY: Critical Gaps

| Gap | Severity | Evidence |
|-----|----------|----------|
| **Theoretical depth is SUPERFICIAL** | 🔴 HIGH | We cite UNESCO 4 pillars but don't map each session activity to specific competency indicators. Where's the backwards design evidence? |
| **No learning progression model** | 🔴 HIGH | How do we know students are ACTUALLY progressing? Week 1 → Week 8 is arbitrary. Where's the cognitive scaffolding theory? |
| **NotebookLM assumptions unverified** | 🟠 MEDIUM | We assume all features work for under-18 accounts. Has anyone tested this? |
| **Assessment validity is HAND-WAVY** | 🔴 HIGH | "Competency-based rubrics" mentioned but not designed. How do we KNOW students achieved outcomes? |
| **Zero differentiation research** | 🟠 MEDIUM | We claim differentiation but cite no UDL (Universal Design for Learning) principles |

**Mental Plane Verdict:** 🟡 **PARTIALLY TRUTH-GROUNDED**
*The research foundation exists but execution is surface-level. Too much name-dropping, not enough operationalization.*

---

### PHYSICAL PLANE (Feasibility/Execution)

#### Strengths
- ✅ 6-minute micro-module structure is practical
- ✅ Tool choices (NotebookLM, Claude, Nano Banana) are all free-tier accessible
- ✅ Session timing (20 min) is realistic for summer program

#### BRUTAL HONESTY: Critical Gaps

| Gap | Severity | Evidence |
|-----|----------|----------|
| **NO instructor training plan** | 🔴 CRITICAL | Who teaches this? Most HS teachers have ZERO AI tool experience. 95% of them don't know what Claude Code is. |
| **Account provisioning is a NIGHTMARE** | 🔴 CRITICAL | 30 students × 3 platforms = 90 accounts. Who manages this? Google Workspace EDU required for NotebookLM class features. Does the school HAVE this? |
| **Network/firewall issues IGNORED** | 🔴 CRITICAL | Many schools block AI tools. Have we tested access from school networks? |
| **Parental consent for AI tools?** | 🟠 HIGH | Students under 18 using AI requires consent. Legal has not been consulted. |
| **Hardware requirements unstated** | 🟠 MEDIUM | Students need laptops? Chromebooks? Mobile? What's the minimum spec? |
| **Fallback activities are "TBD"** | 🟠 MEDIUM | When NotebookLM goes down mid-session, what happens? |
| **XP/Gamification tracking HOW?** | 🟠 MEDIUM | Leaderboards mentioned. What system? Google Sheets? LMS? Custom app? |

**Physical Plane Verdict:** 🔴 **NOT EXECUTION-READY**
*This curriculum cannot be taught tomorrow. Massive infrastructure gaps. Would fail on Day 1 at a typical public high school.*

---

### SPIRITUAL PLANE (Ethics/Values/Meaning)

#### Strengths
- ✅ Ethics module explicitly included (Week 5)
- ✅ Critical thinking about AI emphasized
- ✅ "AI Detective" promotes awareness of AI in daily life

#### BRUTAL HONESTY: Critical Gaps

| Gap | Severity | Evidence |
|-----|----------|----------|
| **Ethics is ONE WEEK, not embedded** | 🟠 HIGH | UNESCO says ethics should be integrated throughout. We silo it in Week 5. |
| **No discussion of AI labor/environmental costs** | 🟠 MEDIUM | Training AI costs money, energy, sometimes exploits workers. Where's that conversation? |
| **"Creepy" framing is juvenile** | 🟡 LOW | Using "creepy" to describe surveillance is dumbing down important privacy discourse |
| **Student data going WHERE?** | 🔴 HIGH | Students typing prompts into Claude/NotebookLM. Who sees that data? Have we disclosed this? |
| **No student voice in curriculum design** | 🟠 MEDIUM | We assume what engages HS students. Have we ASKED any actual students? |
| **Over-optimistic about AI** | 🟠 MEDIUM | Gen Z is "optimistic" - but are we just training future tech consumers rather than critical citizens? |

**Spiritual Plane Verdict:** 🟡 **PARTIALLY VALUES-ALIGNED**
*Ethics is present but performative. Deeper questions about AI labor, data, and critical citizenship are avoided.*

## MERCURIO CONVERGENCE ASSESSMENT

### Where Planes Converge ✅

| Convergence Point | Mental | Physical | Spiritual |
|-------------------|--------|----------|-----------|
| Microlearning structure | Research-backed | Practical | Respects attention |
| Hands-on tool use | Learning by doing | Tools available | Empowering |
| Portfolio output | Demonstrates learning | Tangible artifact | Pride/ownership |

### Where Planes CONFLICT ❌

| Conflict | Tension Description | Resolution Needed |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Research rigor vs. Execution** | We cite UNESCO but haven't operationalized it into actual lesson plans | Create detailed lesson plans with competency mapping |
| **Tool promises vs. Reality** | We assume tools work seamlessly in school environments | Pilot test with actual school infrastructure |
| **Ethics as add-on vs. Core** | Week 5 ethics module vs. "ethics should be embedded" research | Integrate ethical reflection into every week |
| **Student agency vs. Prescribed curriculum** | We designed for students, not with them | Co-design session with actual HS students |

## MARS SYSTEMS-LEVEL ANALYSIS

### Domain Decomposition

| Domain | Status | Critical Finding |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| **Curriculum Design** | 🟡 Partial | Content exists but lacks granular lesson plans |
| **Instructor Readiness** | 🔴 Missing | No training materials, no facilitation guides |
| **Technical Infrastructure** | 🔴 Missing | No account provisioning, no network testing |
| **Assessment System** | 🔴 Missing | Rubrics mentioned but not developed |
| **Administrative Support** | 🔴 Missing | No consent forms, no principal buy-in, no parent communication |
| **Continuous Improvement** | 🟠 Weak | Feedback loops mentioned but not designed |

### Constraint Analysis

| Constraint Type | Constraint | Current Status |
|-----------------|------------|----------------|
| **Hard** | COPPA compliance for under-13 (if applicable) | NOT VERIFIED |
| **Hard** | School district AI policy | NOT CONSULTED |
| **Soft** | Teacher training time | NOT BUDGETED |
| **Soft** | Budget for materials | ASSUMED FREE |
| **Self-Imposed** | "Use only free tools" | SHOULD VERIFY |

### Leverage Points Identified

**Highest Leverage (Focus Here):**
1. **Instructor training** - If teachers can't teach this, nothing else matters
2. **Technical pilot** - Test tools on actual school network before curriculum launch
3. **Assessment design** - Without valid assessment, can't prove learning happened

**Medium Leverage:**
4. Ethics integration throughout (not just Week 5)
5. Student co-design session

## CONCLUSION

### The Brutal Truth

This curriculum has a **solid conceptual foundation** but is **nowhere near execution-ready**.

The research is legitimate. The tool choices are smart. The engagement strategies are research-backed.

But:
- **You cannot teach this tomorrow.** Technical infrastructure is undefined.
- **You cannot prove it works.** Assessment system doesn't exist.
- **You cannot train teachers to deliver it.** No instructor guide.
- **You cannot get parent approval.** No consent forms or privacy disclosures.

### Path Forward

1. **Accept the gaps.** This is Iteration 1. It's supposed to be rough.
2. **Execute Priority 1 actions.** Without these, curriculum is dead on arrival.
3. **Pilot test with 5 real students.** Learn what actually breaks.
4. **Return with Iteration 2 artifacts.** Then request second-round approval.

### Recommended Next Steps

```
Week -4: Instructor training development + Student co-design session
Week -3: Technical infrastructure verification + Assessment rubric design
Week -2: Legal/consent documentation + Offline fallback creation
Week -1: Pilot test with 5 students + Final iteration based on results
Week 0:  Pitch deck presentation with full artifact support
```
