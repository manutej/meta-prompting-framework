## 🔄 Recursive Meta-Prompt Template for Week 1

This template can be used by instructors to generate additional lab variations:

```markdown
# Meta-Prompt: Week 1 Lab Generator

## Context
I am designing hands-on labs for high school students (ages 14-18) in their
first week of AI literacy education. Students have 8-second attention spans
and need immediate, tangible results.

## Constraints
- Lab duration: Maximum 10 minutes
- Tool required: [NotebookLM | Claude Code | Nano Banana Pro]
- Skill level: Complete beginner
- Output: Something they can show/share

## Current Learning Objective
[INSERT SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE]

## Recursive Improvement Request
Generate a lab activity that:
1. Has a 2-minute hook that creates curiosity
2. Provides step-by-step instructions (numbered, simple language)
3. Includes at least 2 "iteration cycles" where students improve their first attempt
4. Ends with a shareable artifact
5. Connects to their daily life

Then, critique your own lab design and improve it based on:
- Engagement potential
- Technical feasibility
- Time management
- Learning outcome alignment

Provide both versions and explain what you improved.
```
