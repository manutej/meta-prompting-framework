# SECTION 1: TEACHING PHILOSOPHY

## Core Principle: "AI as Creator, Student as Evaluator"

**Your role is NOT to:**
- Lecture about AI capabilities
- Demonstrate impressive AI outputs
- Show students "cool tricks"

**Your role IS to:**
- Facilitate hands-on discovery
- Ask probing questions when students show AI outputs
- Model critical evaluation habits
- Celebrate human judgment over AI sophistication

## The Evaluation Reflex

Train students to automatically ask after ANY AI output:
1. "Is this accurate?"
2. "What's missing?"
3. "What would I add?"

**Instructor modeling:** Every time you demo an AI output, verbally evaluate it. "Hmm, this looks good but I notice it didn't mention [X]. Let me check if [Y] is accurate."

## Attention-Span Management

**The 8-Second Rule:** You have 8 seconds to capture attention at transitions.

**Energy Indicators:**
- 👀 Eyes on screens = engaged
- 📱 Phone checking = losing them
- 💬 Side conversations = need mode switch
- 😴 Slumping = need energy reset

**Recovery Techniques:**
- "Turn to your partner and share..."
- "Stand up and stretch for 30 seconds"
- "Who found something surprising? Share with the class"
- "Quick poll: thumbs up/down on..."

# SECTION 2: TOOL SETUP GUIDE

## Account Provisioning Strategy

### Option A: Individual Student Accounts (Recommended)
- Students create own accounts with personal/school email
- More ownership, portfolio persists after course
- Requires: Clear instructions, consent forms

### Option B: Shared Class Accounts
- One account per tool, shared credentials
- Simpler setup, less individual ownership
- Requires: Clear usage guidelines, password management

### Option C: Instructor-Controlled Demo Only
- Students observe, don't interact directly
- Least engaging, but works with tech restrictions
- Requires: More demo time, less hands-on

### Common Student Questions

**Q: "Can I use ChatGPT for my homework?"**
A: "That's exactly what we're figuring out together. By the end of this course, YOU will know when it's appropriate and when it isn't."

**Q: "Why can't I just use AI to write everything?"**
A: "Let's try something. Ask AI to write about your most embarrassing moment. [They can't.] AI doesn't have YOUR experiences. That's what makes YOUR voice matter."

**Q: "Is this AI going to take my job?"**
A: "Maybe some jobs. But the jobs of the future need people who can DIRECT AI, not just use it. That's what you're learning."

### Troubleshooting

# SECTION 4: COMMON CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS

## Classroom Management

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Students racing ahead | Assign "mentor" role—help struggling classmates for bonus XP |
| Students falling behind | Pair with peer mentor, simplify to core activity only |
| Students off-task on AI | Redirect: "Show me what you're creating" (makes it educational) |
| Students sharing inappropriate content | Review safety settings, remind of guidelines, document if needed |

## Technical Issues

| Issue | Immediate Solution | Prevention |
|-------|-------------------|------------|
| Tool is down | Switch to alternative (see tool table) | Always have backup logged in |
| Rate limits hit | Rotate students or use demo mode | Stagger heavy usage |
| Network blocking | Mobile hotspot or offline fallback | Pre-test on school network |
| Account issues | Use shared backup account | Verify accounts day before |

## Content Concerns

| Concern | Response |
|---------|----------|
| AI generates inappropriate content | "This is why we evaluate everything. What should AI NOT have said?" |
| Student shares problematic output | "Let's discuss why this happened. AI reflects its training data—including biases." |
| Parent complains about AI use | Share consent form they signed, explain evaluation-focused pedagogy |

---

# SECTION 5: ASSESSMENT QUICK REFERENCE

## Daily XP Tracking

| Activity | XP | Notes |
|----------|-----|-------|
| Lab completion | 20 | Verified by screenshot or output |
| Helping classmate | 10 | Instructor observes and awards |
| Finding hallucination | 15 | Document the error found |
| Perfect prompt (A grade) | 25 | Meets all rubric criteria |
| Homework submitted | 30 | On time, complete |
| Attendance | 10 | Present and participating |

## Quick Evaluation Questions

When reviewing student work, ask:
1. Did they USE AI appropriately? (tool selection)
2. Did they EVALUATE AI output? (evidence of critical thinking)
3. Did they IMPROVE the output? (iteration visible)
4. Did they ADD something AI couldn't? (human contribution)
5. Did they DISCLOSE AI use? (transparency)

---

# SECTION 6: EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

## Complete Technology Failure

**If all AI tools are inaccessible:**

### Offline Fallback Activities (by session)

| Session | Offline Activity |
|---------|------------------|
| 1 | "AI or Human?" game with printed examples + ethics discussion |
| 2 | Prompt improvement on paper, peer review |
| 3 | Sketch-based presentation planning |
| 4 | Audio script writing + peer recording |
| 5 | Storyboard creation for video |
| 6 | Production planning document |
| 7 | Study strategy design on paper |
| 8 | Charter writing + discussion |

## Student Crisis

**If student misuses AI for harm:**
1. Stop the activity privately
2. Document what happened
3. Report to administration per school policy
4. Follow up with restorative conversation
