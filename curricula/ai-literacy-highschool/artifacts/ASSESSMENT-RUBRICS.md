# AI Literacy Mastery: Detailed Assessment Rubrics
## Competency-Based Evaluation Framework

---

# GRADING PHILOSOPHY

**Core Principle:** We assess the quality of HUMAN JUDGMENT demonstrated—how well students direct AI, evaluate outputs, and improve upon generated content—NOT the sophistication of AI-generated material alone.

**Weight Distribution:**
- Skills Demonstration: 40%
- Projects: 40%
- Reflection & Ethics: 20%

# RUBRIC 1: PROMPT CRAFTING (Sessions 1-2)

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Excellent (4) | Proficient (3) | Developing (2) | Beginning (1) |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Specificity** | Prompt includes precise details, constraints, format requirements | Prompt has good detail, some constraints | Prompt has basic detail | Prompt is vague, missing key details |
| **Context Setting** | Rich context including audience, purpose, background | Adequate context provided | Some context provided | Little or no context |
| **Format Direction** | Clear output structure specified with examples | Output format mentioned | Basic format mentioned | No format guidance |
| **Iteration** | Multiple refined versions with documented improvements | 2-3 versions with some improvement | One revision attempted | No iteration |
| **SPEC Application** | All SPEC elements applied strategically | Most SPEC elements present | Some SPEC elements used | SPEC not applied |

## Scoring Guide

| Score | Points | Interpretation |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| 16-20 | A | Excellent—demonstrates mastery of prompt engineering |
| 12-15 | B | Proficient—solid understanding with room for refinement |
| 8-11 | C | Developing—basic competency, needs more practice |
| 4-7 | D | Beginning—significant improvement needed |

## Sample Student Work: EXCELLENT (A)

**Original Prompt (v1):**
```
"Tell me about the Civil War"
```

**Refined Prompt (v3):**
```
"You are a history tutor helping a 10th-grade student prepare
for an AP US History exam. Explain the 4 main causes of the
American Civil War (economic differences, states' rights,
slavery, and election of Lincoln). For each cause:
- Provide one specific historical example
- Explain how it contributed to the conflict
- Use language appropriate for a high school student

Format as 4 numbered sections, 3-4 sentences each.
End with a 2-sentence summary connecting all causes."
```

**Why Excellent:**
- Clear role/audience (AP US History student)
- Specific constraints (4 causes, specific length)
- Format clearly defined (numbered sections)
- Visible iteration from vague to specific
- All SPEC elements present

# RUBRIC 2: CRITICAL EVALUATION (Sessions 1-3)

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Excellent (4) | Proficient (3) | Developing (2) | Beginning (1) |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Error Detection** | Identifies subtle errors, hallucinations, biases | Finds obvious errors and some subtle ones | Finds obvious errors only | Misses most errors |
| **Verification** | Uses multiple authoritative sources to verify | Uses at least one source to verify | Attempts verification | No verification |
| **Analysis Depth** | Explains WHY AI made the error, pattern recognition | Explains the error clearly | Describes error but not why | Just labels "wrong" |
| **Improvement Suggestions** | Specific, actionable improvements proposed | Good improvement suggestions | Basic suggestions | No improvements suggested |

## Scoring Guide

| Score | Points | Interpretation |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| 13-16 | A | Critical thinker—catches what others miss |
| 10-12 | B | Good evaluator—reliable error detection |
| 7-9 | C | Developing—needs more practice with verification |
| 4-6 | D | Beginning—accepts AI output too readily |

## Sample Evaluation: EXCELLENT (A)

**AI Output Evaluated:**
```
"The Battle of Gettysburg occurred on July 1-3, 1864, and resulted
in approximately 50,000 casualties. General Robert E. Lee's victory
at Gettysburg marked the turning point of the war in favor of the
Confederacy."
```

**Student Evaluation:**
```
ERRORS FOUND:

1. DATE ERROR: Gettysburg was July 1-3, 1863 (not 1864)
   - Verified via Britannica and National Park Service
   - AI likely confused with another 1864 battle

2. OUTCOME ERROR: Lee LOST Gettysburg, it was a Union victory
   - This is a significant factual inversion
   - Wikipedia, History.com, and textbook all confirm Union victory

3. CONSEQUENCE ERROR: Turning point was FOR the Union, not Confederacy
   - AI got the battle outcome backwards so consequence is also inverted

WHY AI MADE THESE ERRORS:
AI may have pattern-matched "Lee" + "Gettysburg" + "turning point"
without correctly linking the DIRECTION of that turning point.
This shows AI can string together related concepts incorrectly.

IMPROVED OUTPUT:
"The Battle of Gettysburg occurred on July 1-3, 1863, and resulted
in approximately 50,000 casualties. General Robert E. Lee's DEFEAT
at Gettysburg marked the turning point of the war in favor of the
UNION, ending Confederate hopes of a successful Northern invasion."
```
