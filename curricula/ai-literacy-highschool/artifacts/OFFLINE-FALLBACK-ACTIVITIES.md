# SESSION 1 FALLBACK: "AI or Human?" Game

**Duration:** 45 minutes
**Materials Needed:** Printed AI vs Human examples (see below), discussion cards

## Activity Structure

### Part 1: The Game (20 min)

**Instructions:**
1. Divide class into pairs or small groups
2. Distribute "AI or Human?" cards
3. For each example, groups decide: Was this written by AI or a human?
4. After each round, reveal answer and discuss

**Example Cards (Print and Cut):**

---
**CARD 1:**
"The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell. It produces ATP through cellular respiration, converting glucose into energy that cells can use."

**ANSWER:** Could be either! This is a common phrase that appears in both human textbooks and AI responses. **Key point:** AI learns from human writing, so sometimes they're indistinguishable for simple facts.

---
**CARD 2:**
"I remember the exact moment I realized I wanted to be a doctor. I was eight years old, sitting in the hospital waiting room while my grandmother recovered from surgery. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, and I watched the nurses move with quiet purpose..."

**ANSWER:** Human. Personal memories with sensory details (buzzing lights, grandmother) are human experiences AI cannot have. **Key point:** AI can write LIKE this, but can't have genuine memories.

---
**CARD 3:**
"Climate change is caused by several factors. First, the burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide. Second, deforestation reduces the planet's ability to absorb CO2. Third, industrial processes emit greenhouse gases. In conclusion, addressing climate change requires a multi-faceted approach."

**ANSWER:** Likely AI. The rigid "First, Second, Third, In conclusion" structure and generic content are AI patterns. **Key point:** AI often writes in predictable structures.

---
**CARD 4:**
"The Battle of Gettysburg, fought from July 1-3, 1864, was a decisive Confederate victory that turned the tide of the American Civil War."

**ANSWER:** AI with errors! The date is wrong (1863) and outcome is inverted (Union victory). **Key point:** AI can sound confident while being completely wrong.

---
**CARD 5:**
"ngl this homework is lowkey impossible 😭 been staring at it for like 2 hours and still dont get derivatives"

**ANSWER:** Human. Current slang, emoji use, and authentic frustration are human markers. **Key point:** AI tends toward formal language unless specifically prompted for casual.

---

### Part 2: Discussion (15 min)

**Discussion Questions:**
1. What patterns help you identify AI writing?
2. What makes human writing unique?
3. Why is it important to be able to tell the difference?
4. When is "AI or Human" NOT the right question? (Sometimes it doesn't matter; what matters is accuracy)

### Part 3: Create Your Own (10 min)

**Activity:**
Students write two short paragraphs on the same topic—one imitating AI style, one in their authentic voice. Partners try to identify which is which.
