# PART I: SESSION-BY-SESSION TOOL INTEGRATION

## Session 1: Foundations — Enhanced

### Original Strengths (Keep These)
- SPEC framework is excellent
- ETHICAL principles comprehensive
- Prompt evolution exercise well-designed

### NEW INTEGRATION: NotebookLM for Verification

**Add after "AI as Creator, Student as Evaluator" section (5 min)**

```markdown
## Lab 1.X: NotebookLM Truth-Checking

WHY: NotebookLM only uses sources YOU upload—no hallucinations from
external training data. Perfect for teaching verification mindset.

ACTIVITY:
1. Upload: Your biology textbook chapter on photosynthesis
2. Ask NotebookLM: "Explain photosynthesis"
3. Compare: NotebookLM response vs. ChatGPT response
4. Observe: NotebookLM cites YOUR textbook. ChatGPT cites... nothing.

KEY INSIGHT: "Grounded" AI (NotebookLM) vs. "Creative" AI (ChatGPT)
→ Different tools for different purposes
→ NotebookLM for accuracy, ChatGPT for brainstorming
```

**Attention Hook Addition:**

```markdown
🎬 OPENING HOOK (2 min)

[Show phone screen]
"I'm going to ask TWO AIs the same question about photosynthesis.
One will make something up. One cannot lie.
Can you guess which is which?"

[Show ChatGPT response with confident but unverifiable claim]
[Show NotebookLM response with page citation from textbook]

"See that page number? NotebookLM can ONLY use what you give it.
ChatGPT makes things up. Today you learn to use both strategically."
```

- RER cycle is well-structured
- Hallucination detection important

### NEW INTEGRATION: Claude Code for Prompt Engineering

**Add after "Iterative Refinement Framework" (8 min)**

```markdown
## Lab 2.X: Claude Code Prompt Versioning

WHY: Claude Code lets you save, compare, and iterate on prompts
systematically—building prompt engineering as a SKILL, not luck.

SETUP: Claude Code sandbox environment

RECURSIVE META-PROMPTING STRUCTURE:

## VERSION 1: Baseline
Prompt: "Explain the causes of World War I"
→ Save as v1.txt
→ Rate output: 1-10 on clarity, accuracy, usefulness
→ Document: What's missing?

## VERSION 2: SPEC Applied
Prompt: "You are a history tutor for a visual learner preparing
for AP European History. Explain the 4 main causes of WWI
(MAIN: Militarism, Alliances, Imperialism, Nationalism) using
a domino analogy. Include one specific example for each cause.
Use bullet points, 3-4 sentences per cause."
→ Save as v2.txt
→ Rate output: 1-10
→ Calculate improvement delta

## VERSION 3: Chain-of-Thought Added
Add to v2: "Before answering, think through why each cause
connected to the others. Show your reasoning."
→ Save as v3.txt
→ Compare all three versions side-by-side

## META-PROMPT (The Magic Moment)
Ask Claude: "Look at my v1, v2, and v3 prompts. What principles
made each version better? Give me 5 rules I can apply to ANY
future prompt."

→ AI teaches you prompt engineering PRINCIPLES
→ Document in journal: "My 5 Prompt Principles"
```

**Key Pedagogical Point:** Students learn to teach themselves by asking AI to explain what worked. This is metacognitive skill-building.

| 📚 Micro-module | 6 min | One concept, immediate application |
| ⚡ Energy reset | 2 min | Partner share, movement, mode switch |
| 🔬 Hands-on lab | 10 min | DO something, not just listen |
| 📝 Checkpoint | 3 min | Quick assessment, XP award |
| 🔁 Repeat cycle | 22 min | Second micro-module + lab |

## Session Hooks (Add to Each)

| Session | Hook |
|---------|------|
| 1 | "Watch me generate homework in 3 seconds. Question: Is ANY of it true?" |
| 2 | "Four words improved AI math scores by 19%. Guess what they are." |
| 3 | "One of these presentations cost $500. One cost $0. Which is which?" |
| 4 | "This song has 50K streams. It was made by a high schooler in 10 minutes." |
| 5 | "This documentary-quality video took 47 minutes to make. Here's how." |
| 6 | "One person. One laptop. Two hours. Six AI tools. Watch what they made." |
| 7 | "2% of colleges allow AI essays. 98% will reject you if caught. But..." |
| 8 | "In 5 years, half of what you learned will be obsolete. Three things won't." |
