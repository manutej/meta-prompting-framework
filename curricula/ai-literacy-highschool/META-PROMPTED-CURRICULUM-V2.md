### Original Structure (45 min)
- Key concepts: 15 min
- Tool introduction: 10 min
- Prompt evolution exercise: 20 min
- Role-based prompting: 10 min

### META-PROMPTED ENHANCEMENT

#### 🎬 HOOK (2 min) — "The Magic Trick"

```markdown
## Opening Challenge

[Instructor shows phone screen]
"Watch this. I'm going to type three words and the AI will write
my entire homework assignment."

[Types: "essay about photosynthesis"]
[AI generates 500 words in 3 seconds]

"Pretty cool, right? But here's the question that will determine
whether you succeed or fail with AI..."

[Pause for effect]

"HOW DO I KNOW IF ANY OF THIS IS TRUE?"

[This is the curriculum's entire philosophy in one moment]
```

#### 📚 MICRO-MODULE 1.1: What AI Actually Is (6 min)

**Visual:** Show token probability diagram
**Key Insight:** "AI predicts the next word based on patterns. It's like autocomplete on steroids."

**Interactive Demo:**
```
Type in ChatGPT: "The capital of France is ___"
AI completes: "Paris"

Now type: "The capital of Narnia is ___"
AI might complete: "Cair Paravel" (from training data)
or make something up entirely

QUESTION: How did it "know" the second one?
ANSWER: It didn't. It predicted what words typically follow.
```

**Attention Reset:** 30-second partner share: "What surprised you about how AI works?"

#### 📚 MICRO-MODULE 1.2: The SPEC Framework (6 min)

**Gamified Practice:**

| Badge Level | Prompt Quality | Example |
|-------------|----------------|---------|
| 🔴 Bronze | Vague | "Tell me about photosynthesis" |
| 🟡 Silver | Has context | "Explain photosynthesis for 10th grade" |
| 🟢 Gold | Full SPEC | "Explain light-dependent reactions for 10th grade bio. Include equation, explain each part, use kitchen analogy. 3 paragraphs." |

**Challenge:** Transform a Bronze prompt to Gold in 2 minutes

#### 🔬 LAB 1.1: NotebookLM Integration (NEW TOOL)

**Objective:** Use NotebookLM to create personalized study guide from class notes

**Materials:**
- NotebookLM access (free via Google account)
- PDF or Google Doc of recent class notes

**Recursive Meta-Prompting Structure:**

```markdown
## ITERATION 1: Upload & Generate
1. Upload class notes to NotebookLM
2. Click "Generate Study Guide"
3. Review AI output

## ITERATION 2: Evaluate & Refine
4. Ask in chat: "What concepts are you uncertain about?"
5. Compare AI study guide to your own understanding
6. Note: Where does AI miss nuance YOU know from class?

## ITERATION 3: Personalize
7. Ask: "Create 5 quiz questions at medium difficulty"
8. Attempt questions WITHOUT looking at notes
9. Use NotebookLM to explain wrong answers

## META-REFLECTION
Ask NotebookLM: "What makes a good study question?"
→ AI explains metacognition principles
→ Students learn HOW to study, not just WHAT
```

**Lab Deliverable:** Screenshot of personalized study guide + 1 question you added that AI didn't think of

#### 🔬 LAB 1.2: Claude Code Prompt Refinement (NEW TOOL)

**Objective:** Experience iterative prompt improvement with version tracking

**Setup:** Claude Code sandbox environment

**Recursive Meta-Prompting Structure:**

```markdown
## LEVEL 1: Basic Prompt
Student input: "Explain mitosis"
→ Save as v1
→ Rate output 1-10

## LEVEL 2: SPEC Applied
Student input: "You are a biology tutor for a visual learner in 10th
grade. Explain mitosis using the analogy of a copy machine.
Include the 4 phases with one key detail each. Use bullet points."
→ Save as v2
→ Rate output 1-10
→ Calculate improvement

## LEVEL 3: Meta-Prompt Magic
Student asks Claude: "Look at my v1 and v2 prompts. What made v2
get a better response? Give me 3 principles I can use next time."
→ AI teaches prompt engineering PRINCIPLES, not just examples
→ Student documents principles in journal

## BONUS: Chain-of-Thought Preview
Add "Let's think step by step" to v2
→ Compare output quality
→ Foreshadow Session 2 content
```

**Lab Deliverable:** v1, v2, and 3 principles learned

## Session 2: Advanced Prompting and the Iterative Improvement Loop

### META-PROMPTED ENHANCEMENT

#### 🎬 HOOK (2 min) — "The 55% to 74% Miracle"

```markdown
"Here's something wild. Researchers gave AI a math test.
It scored 55%—barely passing.

Then they added FOUR WORDS to every question.

Score jumped to 74%.

What were the four words?"

[Students guess]

"Let's think step by step."

That's it. That's what we're learning today."
```

#### 📚 MICRO-MODULE 2.1: Chain-of-Thought Prompting (6 min)

**Live Demo:** Train problem from curriculum

**Side-by-Side Comparison:**

| Without CoT | With CoT |
|-------------|----------|
| "When do trains meet?" | "When do trains meet? Let's solve step by step." |
| AI: "2:30 PM" (just answer) | AI: "Step 1: Calculate relative speed... Step 2: Time for distance... Step 3: Therefore..." |
| Student: "Is this right?" | Student: "I can check each step!" |

**Key Insight:** CoT makes AI show its work—just like you're required to in math class.

relaxing but mentally engaging, instrumental only"

Example: "Lo-fi study music with subtle references to the American
Revolution, sounds of quill pens and distant cannons sampled,
relaxing but historically atmospheric"

Evaluate: Does topic integration help or distract?

## PHASE 3: Refinement
Take best version, refine:
"Make it slightly more [energetic/calm], adjust tempo to
[higher/lower], add/remove [specific element]"

Document: How many iterations to reach "perfect" version?
```

**Lab Deliverable:** 3 study tracks + reflection on which works best for you and why

#### 🔬 LAB 4.2: NotebookLM Audio Overview for Studying (NEW INTEGRATION)

**Objective:** Transform notes into podcast-style study content
