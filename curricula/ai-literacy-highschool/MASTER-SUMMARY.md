# 1. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

## What Is This Program?

AI Literacy Mastery is a comprehensive 8-session curriculum that teaches high school students to use AI tools ethically, effectively, and critically. Built on the philosophy of **"AI as Creator, Student as Evaluator,"** the program transforms students from passive AI consumers into informed AI directors.

## Why Does It Matter? (Real Numbers)

| Finding | Source |
|---------|--------|
| **86%** of students used AI in the 2024-25 school year | Center for Democracy & Technology |
| **26%** of teens used ChatGPT for schoolwork in 2024 (doubled from 13% in 2023) | Pew Research Center, Jan 2025 |
| **53%** of students use AI specifically for homework | Common Sense Media, Sept 2024 |
| **37%** don't know if their school has rules about AI | Common Sense Media |
| **Only 48%** of teachers received any AI training | CDT, 2024-25 |

Students are using AI at scale. Most teachers haven't been trained. Most schools don't have clear policies. This is the gap we close.

## What Makes This Different?

| Traditional Approach | Our Approach |
|---------------------|--------------|
| Ban AI tools | Master AI tools |
| React to misuse | Prevent misuse through education |
| Focus on detection | Focus on evaluation skills |
| Restrict access | Teach responsible access |
| One-time policy | Ongoing skill development |

## Key Outcomes

After completing this program, students can:

1. **Craft effective prompts** using the SPEC framework
2. **Critically evaluate** AI output for accuracy and bias
3. **Create multimodal content** (visual, audio, video) with AI
4. **Build personalized study systems** using AI tools
5. **Articulate ethical boundaries** for AI use in academics
6. **Demonstrate skills** through a portfolio of 15-20 artifacts

# 2. THE PROBLEM WE SOLVE

## The Academic Integrity Crisis (Real Data)

### What's Actually Happening

| Finding | Source |
|---------|--------|
| **Nearly 7,000** cases of AI-related cheating at UK universities (2023-24) | UK Higher Education Statistics |
| **3x increase** from previous year | UK Higher Education Statistics |
| ChatGPT-generated exam answers went **undetected in 94% of cases** | University of Reading (Scarfe et al., 2024) |
| Those undetected answers achieved **higher grades on average** | University of Reading |
| **96%** of instructors believe at least some students cheated using AI | Wiley Survey, 2024 |

### The Student Awareness Gap

| Finding | Source |
|---------|--------|
| **80%** of students say using an LLM is "somewhat" or "definitely" cheating | Frontiers in Education, 2024 |
| Yet **53%** still use it for homework | Common Sense Media |
| **67%** feel they are shortcutting their learning | Turnitin, 2025 |

The gap between knowing it's wrong and doing it anyway indicates a failure of education, not character.

## The Teacher Training Gap

| Finding | Source |
|---------|--------|
| **Only 48%** of teachers received any AI training from their schools | CDT, 2024-25 |
| **Only 7 countries** worldwide had AI teacher training frameworks as of 2022 | UNESCO |
| **Less than half** of high school CS teachers feel equipped to teach AI | Stanford HAI, 2025 |

## College Admissions: Real Stakes

These are direct quotes from university policy statements:

### Yale University
> "Submitting the substantive content or output of an artificial intelligence platform **constitutes application fraud**."
>
> "Submitting personal statements composed by text-generating software may result in **admission revocation or expulsion**."

*Source: Yale College Undergraduate Admissions, AI Policy Statement*

### Brown University
> "The use of artificial intelligence by an applicant is **not permitted under any circumstances** in conjunction with application content."

*Source: Brown University Admissions*

### Common Application (1,000+ colleges)
> Explicitly treats **submitting AI-generated content as application fraud**.

*Source: Common Application binding agreement*

Students need to know these lines exist. Most don't.

## The Opportunity

Students who learn AI literacy NOW will:
- Lead in AI-integrated careers
- Maintain authentic voices alongside AI tools
- Contribute to ethical AI development
- Think critically about AI in society

```

## Three Guiding Principles

### Principle 1: AI Amplifies, Never Replaces

AI is a cognitive partner that enhances student capabilities. Students retain ownership of the creative and analytical process. The goal is **AI-assisted thinking**, not **AI-replaced thinking**.

### Principle 2: Transparency Builds Trust

All AI use is disclosed and documented. Students learn citation practices, develop disclosure habits, and understand why transparency matters in academics and careers.

### Principle 3: Creation Through Iteration

Excellence emerges from cycles of:
1. AI generation
2. Human evaluation
3. Collaborative refinement
4. Personal contribution

## The Evaluation Reflex

Students are trained to automatically ask after ANY AI output:
1. "Is this accurate?"
2. "What's missing?"
3. "What would I add?"

This reflex—not any specific tool knowledge—is the permanent skill we build.

## What Research Actually Shows About Gen Z Learning

### The "8-Second Attention Span" Is a Myth

This claim appears everywhere. It is not true.

**The Origin:**
In 2015, Microsoft marketing claimed humans have 8-second attention spans—less than goldfish. The BBC investigated in 2017 and found:
- The number came from "Statistic Brain," who **could not provide a credible source**
- Organizations cited (like NCBI) stated they **cannot verify the claims**
- The goldfish comparison is also false—no one knows how to measure goldfish attention

### What Real Research Shows

**Dr. Gloria Mark, UC Irvine (Longitudinal study):**

| Year | Average time on screen before switching |
|------|----------------------------------------|
| 2004 | 150 seconds (2.5 minutes) |
| 2012 | 75 seconds |
| 2021 | 47 seconds |

This measures **attention switching on screens**, not attention capacity. The same teenagers "unable to focus" binge-watch entire seasons (Netflix: 61% regularly watch 2-6 episodes consecutively) and game for hours.

### The Actual Issue
- **49%** of interruptions are self-initiated
- It takes **~25 minutes** to return to focused work after interruption
- This is about attention deployment patterns, not cognitive incapacity

## Evidence-Based Learning Strategies

| Strategy | Evidence | Our Application |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| **8-12 minute segments** for microlearning | Meta-analysis: 0.74 SD improvement | 6-10 minute activity blocks |
| **Retrieval practice** (testing yourself) | Effect size g = 0.50 (159 studies) | Self-testing without AI, then feedback |
| **Spaced repetition** | 2-3x higher retention rates | Concepts revisited across sessions |
| **Learning by doing** over passive listening | APA adolescent development research | 70%+ hands-on, minimal lecture |

We don't design for a myth. We design for what actually works.

## Real Programs Showing Results

**MIT RAISE (Responsible AI for Social Empowerment)**
- Curriculum tested across 9 pilot sites, 4 countries, ~282 students
- Positive shifts in attitudes toward AI
- Particular success with underrepresented groups in STEM

**Raspberry Pi Experience AI (with DeepMind)**
- **95%** of teachers: training increased knowledge and confidence
