# 1. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

## What Is This Program?

AI Literacy Mastery is a comprehensive 8-session curriculum that teaches high school students to use AI tools ethically, effectively, and critically. Built on the philosophy of **"AI as Creator, Student as Evaluator,"** the program transforms students from passive AI consumers into informed AI directors.

## Why Does It Matter?

- **97%** of students have used AI for schoolwork
- **0%** have received formal instruction on how to use it
- **98%** of colleges prohibit AI-generated essays
- **100%** of future careers will involve AI collaboration

## What Makes This Different?

| Traditional Approach | Our Approach |
|---------------------|--------------|
| Ban AI tools | Master AI tools |
| React to misuse | Prevent misuse through education |
| Focus on detection | Focus on evaluation skills |
| Restrict access | Teach responsible access |
| One-time policy | Ongoing skill development |

## Key Outcomes

After completing this program, students can:

1. **Craft effective prompts** using the SPEC framework
2. **Critically evaluate** AI output for accuracy and bias
3. **Create multimodal content** (visual, audio, video) with AI
4. **Build personalized study systems** using AI tools
5. **Articulate ethical boundaries** for AI use in academics
6. **Demonstrate skills** through a portfolio of 15-20 artifacts

## Three Guiding Principles

### Principle 1: AI Amplifies, Never Replaces

AI is a cognitive partner that enhances student capabilities. Students retain ownership of the creative and analytical process. The goal is **AI-assisted thinking**, not **AI-replaced thinking**.

### Principle 2: Transparency Builds Trust

All AI use is disclosed and documented. Students learn citation practices, develop disclosure habits, and understand why transparency matters in academics and careers.

### Principle 3: Creation Through Iteration

Excellence emerges from cycles of:
1. AI generation
2. Human evaluation
3. Collaborative refinement
4. Personal contribution

## The Evaluation Reflex

Students are trained to automatically ask after ANY AI output:
1. "Is this accurate?"
2. "What's missing?"
3. "What would I add?"

This reflex—not any specific tool knowledge—is the permanent skill we build.
