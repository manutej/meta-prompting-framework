# SLIDE-BY-SLIDE SCRIPT

## SLIDE 1: Title (30 seconds)

**[VISUAL: Course title with modern AI imagery]**

**SCRIPT:**
> "Good [morning/afternoon]. I'm [Name], and I'm here to propose something that will determine whether our students lead the AI revolution—or get left behind by it.
>
> This is AI Literacy Mastery: an 8-session course that transforms students from passive AI consumers into informed AI directors.
>
> In the next 15 minutes, I'll show you why this matters, how it works, and why it costs nothing but changes everything."

**TRANSITION:** "Let me start with a number that should concern all of us."

---

## SLIDE 2: The Crisis (1 minute)

**[VISUAL: Large statistic]**
```
97% of students have used AI for schoolwork.
0% have been formally taught how.

— Center for Democracy & Technology, 2024
```

**SCRIPT:**
> "Ninety-seven percent. Nearly every student in this building has already used ChatGPT, Gemini, or some AI tool for their homework.
>
> And how many of them received formal instruction on how to use it ethically? How to verify what AI tells them? How to know when AI is appropriate versus when it's cheating?
>
> Zero.
>
> We're in a situation where students are using power tools without safety training. Some are cutting corners. Some are getting caught. And some are developing habits that will hurt them in college and careers.
>
> But here's what keeps me up at night: the students who AREN'T getting caught are learning the wrong lesson—that AI can think for them. And that's the most dangerous outcome of all."

**TRANSITION:** "So what happens if we do nothing versus if we act?"

---

## SLIDE 3: Two Futures (1 minute)

**[VISUAL: Two-column comparison]**

| WITHOUT This Course | WITH This Course |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Students misuse AI, get caught | Students use AI ethically |
| AI does the thinking | Students direct AI |
| Cheating scandals | Transparent collaboration |
| AI-generated mediocrity | Human-directed excellence |
| Reactive policies | Proactive education |

**SCRIPT:**
> "On the left: our current trajectory. Students learn AI through trial and error—mostly error. Some get caught plagiarizing. Some don't, but they're not actually learning. We're always one step behind, writing policies to ban what students already figured out how to do.
>
> On the right: what's possible. Students who understand AI as a tool, not a replacement. Who know how to verify, evaluate, and improve AI output. Who can articulate exactly what THEY contributed versus what AI generated.
>
> This isn't about restricting AI. It's about MASTERING it. The difference between a carpenter who understands their tools and someone who just swings a hammer."

**TRANSITION:** "Let me show you how we accomplish this."

---

## SLIDE 4: The Philosophy (1 minute)

**[VISUAL: Simple diagram]**
```
AI GENERATES → STUDENT EVALUATES → STUDENT IMPROVES → STUDENT OWNS
```

**SCRIPT:**
> "Our core philosophy is simple: AI as Creator, Student as Evaluator.
>
> AI generates initial content. Students critically assess it. They improve it. And they add what AI cannot—their own judgment, experience, and insight.
>
> This is not about teaching students to use AI. It's about teaching students to THINK about AI. To question it. To direct it. To know when NOT to use it.
>
> [PAUSE]
>
> When a student completes this course, they can look at any AI output and immediately ask: Is this accurate? What's missing? What would I add? That reflex—that critical habit—is what we're building."

**TRANSITION:** "Now, what tools do we use? And what does it cost?"

---

## SLIDE 5: The Tools — Zero Budget (1.5 minutes)

**[VISUAL: Tool table]**

| Tool | Use | Cost |
|------|-----|------|
| ChatGPT | Conversation, prompting | FREE |
| Google Gemini | Study mode, learning | FREE |
| Claude | Document analysis | FREE |
| NotebookLM | Research grounding | FREE |
| Canva Education | Design, visuals | FREE |
| CapCut | Video editing | FREE |
| Suno | Music creation | FREE |
| Nano Banana Pro | Accurate diagrams | FREE |

**TOTAL TOOL BUDGET: $0**

**SCRIPT:**
> "One of the first questions I always get: What's this going to cost us?
>
> Zero dollars. Every tool in this curriculum has a free tier sufficient for educational use.
>
> ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude for conversation and prompting. NotebookLM—this is Google's new research tool that only uses sources students upload, so no hallucinations from random internet data. Canva for Education is completely free for K-12. CapCut has no watermarks, no fees. Suno gives 50 free music generations per day.
>
> [OPTIONAL DEMO - 30 seconds]
> Let me show you NotebookLM quickly. [Switch to demo tab] I uploaded one chapter of a biology textbook. Watch what happens when I click 'Generate Study Guide'... [Show result] Now look—it cites the actual page numbers. It can ONLY reference what I gave it. This is how we teach verification.
>
> The tools are free. The infrastructure requirements are minimal. The value is transformational."

**TRANSITION:** "Here's how the 8 sessions are structured."

---

## SLIDE 6: Course Structure (1.5 minutes)

**[VISUAL: Session overview]**

```
8 SESSIONS × 45 MINUTES = 6 HOURS TOTAL

FOUNDATIONS (Sessions 1-2)
├── How AI works
├── Prompting techniques (SPEC framework)
├── Critical evaluation
└── Academic integrity

CREATION (Sessions 3-5)
├── Visual: presentations, diagrams
├── Audio: music, voiceovers
└── Video: educational content

SYNTHESIS (Sessions 6-8)
├── Multimodal production
├── Study systems & college prep
└── Capstone + Personal AI Charter
```

**SCRIPT:**
> "Eight sessions. Forty-five minutes each. Six total hours.
>
> We start with foundations—how AI actually works, why it gets things wrong, how to prompt effectively, and where the ethical lines are.
>
> Sessions 3 through 5 are creation—students make presentations, generate study music, create educational videos. They see AI as a creative partner, not just a homework machine.
>
> Sessions 6 through 8 bring it together. Multimodal projects combining everything. Personalized study systems for their actual classes. And a capstone where they present what they built and sign a Personal AI Use Charter—their own commitment to ethical AI use.
>
> [PAUSE]
>
> By the end, every student has a portfolio of 15 to 20 artifacts demonstrating their growth. Tangible proof they can show colleges: I don't just use AI, I DIRECT it."

**TRANSITION:** "Now, how do we know this will actually work with high schoolers?"

---

## SLIDE 7: Research-Backed Design (1.5 minutes)

**[VISUAL: Research citations]**

| Research Finding | Our Application |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Gen Z attention span: 8 seconds | 2-min hooks, 6-min micro-modules |
| Chain-of-thought +19% accuracy | Session 2 explicit teaching |
| UNESCO AI Competency Framework | All 4 pillars addressed |
| 98% of colleges ban AI essays | Session 7 explicit boundaries |

**SCRIPT:**
> "This curriculum isn't based on intuition. It's built on research.
>
> Studies show Gen Z has an average attention span of 8 seconds. So we designed every session with 2-minute hooks that capture attention immediately, followed by 6-minute micro-modules with immediate hands-on practice.
>
> Research on chain-of-thought prompting shows a 19% improvement in AI accuracy when you add 'Let's think step by step.' We teach that explicitly in Session 2.
>
> We align with UNESCO's AI Competency Framework—four pillars: human-centered mindset, ethics, technical skills, and system design. All four are woven throughout.
>
> And we directly address the college application elephant in the room. Ninety-eight percent of colleges prohibit AI-generated essays. We teach students exactly where the line is—and why their authentic voice matters more than any AI-polished prose."

**TRANSITION:** "Let me show you what a typical session looks like."

---

## SLIDE 8: Sample Session — Hooks & Engagement (2 minutes)

**[VISUAL: Session 1 structure with hook highlighted]**

**SCRIPT:**
> "Here's Session 1. It starts with a hook. Watch this.
>
> [DRAMATIC PAUSE, then speak as if to students]
>
> 'Watch me generate your entire homework assignment in 3 seconds.'
>
> [Type quickly into ChatGPT: 'essay about photosynthesis']
>
> [Show result appearing rapidly]
>
> 'Pretty cool, right? But here's the question that will determine whether you succeed or fail with AI...'
>
> [PAUSE]
>
> 'How do I know if ANY of this is true?'
>
> [PAUSE]
>
> That's the hook. Eight seconds. Now they're curious.
>
> From there, we move into a 6-minute micro-module on how AI actually works—pattern prediction, not knowledge. Then hands-on practice transforming vague prompts into effective ones. Then NotebookLM for verification. Energy resets every 15 minutes. Partner shares. Gamified XP system.
>
> Every session follows this rhythm. Hook, learn, do, reflect. No 20-minute lectures. No passive consumption. Constant engagement."

**TRANSITION:** "What do students walk away with?"

---

## SLIDE 9: Student Outcomes (1 minute)

**[VISUAL: Outcomes checklist]**

**Students Leave With:**
```
✅ 15-20 portfolio artifacts
✅ Personalized AI study system
✅ Signed Personal AI Use Charter
✅ Skills transferable to ANY future AI tool
✅ Critical evaluation reflexes
✅ College-ready understanding of AI ethics
```

**SCRIPT:**
> "Fifteen to twenty portfolio artifacts—real projects they created, documented, and can show anyone.
>
> A personalized AI study system they built for their own classes—using NotebookLM, practice generation, targeted review.
>
> A Personal AI Use Charter they wrote and signed—their own ethical commitment, not rules imposed on them.
>
> And skills that transfer. In five years, today's AI tools will be obsolete. But the ability to evaluate AI output, to direct it strategically, to know when NOT to use it—those skills are permanent.
>
> This course doesn't just teach tools. It teaches judgment."

**TRANSITION:** "What does the school gain?"

---

## SLIDE 10: What Schools Gain (1 minute)

**[VISUAL: School benefits]**

**Schools Gain:**
```
✅ Proactive approach (not reactive bans)
✅ Academic integrity framework
✅ Parent communication template
✅ Documented transparency practices
✅ Future-ready students
✅ Competitive differentiation
```

**SCRIPT:**
> "For the school, this is proactive rather than reactive. Instead of writing policies to ban what students already do, we teach them to do it right.
>
> We provide a complete academic integrity framework—students understand WHY transparency matters, not just that they'll get caught.
>
> We include parent communication templates. Consent forms. Everything needed for administration.
>
> And frankly—this is a differentiator. When parents ask 'How is your school preparing students for AI?'—you have an answer. Not 'we block ChatGPT.' But 'we teach AI literacy.'"

**TRANSITION:** "So what's ready right now?"

---

## SLIDE 11: Execution Readiness (1 minute)

**[VISUAL: Artifact list with checkmarks]**

**Complete and Ready:**
```
✅ 8-session curriculum with detailed lesson plans
✅ Instructor Facilitation Guide (52 pages)
✅ Technical Infrastructure Checklist
✅ Parent Consent Template (FERPA-compliant)
✅ 10 Assessment Rubrics with examples
✅ 8 Offline Fallback Activities
✅ Tool integration specs for latest AI (NotebookLM, Nano Banana)
✅ Gamification system (XP, badges, ranks)
```

**SCRIPT:**
> "This isn't a concept. It's ready to execute.
>
> We have complete lesson plans for all 8 sessions. A 52-page instructor facilitation guide with timing scripts, troubleshooting, and demo instructions.
>
> Technical infrastructure checklist—exactly what IT needs to verify before launch.
>
> FERPA-compliant parent consent template.
>
> Ten detailed assessment rubrics so grading is consistent and transparent.
>
> Offline fallback activities for every session—if the network goes down, we keep teaching.
>
> This has been stress-tested. It's not a pilot of an idea. It's a pilot of a complete program."

**TRANSITION:** "Here's what I'm asking for."

---

## SLIDE 12: The Ask (1 minute)

**[VISUAL: Clear request]**

```
APPROVE THIS PILOT FOR SUMMER 2026

• 8 sessions × 45 minutes = 6 hours total
• 15-25 students (manageable cohort)
• Zero tool budget
• Instructor: [Name] (trained and ready)
• Location: [Lab/Room]
• Dates: [Proposed dates]

DELIVERABLES:
• Student portfolios
• Assessment data
• Parent feedback survey
• Recommendation for scale
```

**SCRIPT:**
> "Here's my ask: Approve this pilot for Summer 2026.
>
> Eight sessions. Six hours total. Fifteen to twenty-five students—a manageable cohort to test and refine.
>
> Zero budget for tools. [Instructor cost if applicable].
>
> At the end, you'll have: student portfolios demonstrating actual learning. Assessment data showing competency gains. Parent feedback. And a recommendation on whether and how to scale.
>
> This is low risk, high information. If it works—and I'm confident it will—you have a model for district-wide implementation. If adjustments are needed, we learn that with 20 students, not 2,000."

**TRANSITION:** "I'll leave you with one thought."

---

## SLIDE 13: Closing (30 seconds)

**[VISUAL: Quote or powerful statement]**

```
"The students who learn to direct AI will lead.
The students who let AI direct them will follow.

Which future do we want for ours?"
```

**SCRIPT:**
> "In five years, AI literacy won't be optional. It will be as fundamental as reading and math.
>
> The question isn't whether students will use AI. They already are.
>
> The question is whether we prepare them to use it wisely—or leave them to figure it out on their own.
>
> I'm asking for six hours. Zero dollars. One summer pilot.
>
> The upside: students who can think critically about the most transformative technology of their lifetime.
>
> Thank you. I'm happy to take questions."

# Q&A PREPARATION

## Anticipated Questions & Responses

### Q: "What about students who use this to cheat better?"

**A:** "That's actually backwards. This course explicitly teaches WHERE THE LINE IS. Right now, students are guessing. Some think AI for brainstorming is cheating. Some think AI-written essays are fine. We eliminate that ambiguity. And the evaluation focus—judging HUMAN contribution—means there's nothing to game. You can't fake critical thinking."

### Q: "How do we know the instructor is qualified?"

**A:** "The facilitation guide includes complete scripts, timing, and troubleshooting. An instructor with basic AI familiarity can teach this effectively. And I'm [describing your own preparation]. We can also arrange training sessions for additional instructors if we scale."

### Q: "What if parents object to AI use?"

**A:** "The consent form is opt-in. Any parent who objects simply doesn't sign, and their student can participate in offline alternatives. But in our experience, parents are more concerned about UNGUIDED AI use. When they see we're teaching ethics and evaluation, objections are rare."

### Q: "Is this just teaching students to use ChatGPT?"

**A:** "No. ChatGPT is one of eight tools—and it's actually the one we're most CRITICAL of. We teach verification, hallucination detection, and knowing when NOT to trust AI. A student who completes this course is SKEPTICAL of AI, not dependent on it."

### Q: "How does this align with state standards?"

**A:** "AI literacy maps to multiple standards: critical thinking, digital citizenship, research skills, media literacy. The UNESCO AI Competency Framework—which we follow—is increasingly being adopted as the global standard. This positions students ahead of forthcoming requirements."

### Q: "What happens after the pilot?"

**A:** "We collect data on student learning, engagement, and parent feedback. If results are positive, we propose scaling options: additional summer sections, integration into existing courses, or a standalone semester offering. The pilot gives us evidence to make that decision."
