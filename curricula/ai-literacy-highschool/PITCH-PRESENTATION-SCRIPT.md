# THE FACTS THAT MATTER

## What's Actually Happening Right Now

### Student AI Usage (Real Numbers)

| Statistic | Source |
|-----------|--------|
| **26%** of U.S. teens used ChatGPT for schoolwork in 2024—**doubled** from 13% in 2023 | Pew Research Center, Jan 2025 |
| **86%** of students used AI in the 2024-25 school year | Center for Democracy & Technology |
| **53%** of students use AI specifically for homework | Common Sense Media, Sept 2024 |
| **37%** of students don't know if their school has rules about AI | Common Sense Media |

### The Training Gap

| Statistic | Source |
|-----------|--------|
| **Only 48%** of teachers received any AI training from their schools | CDT, 2024-25 |
| **Only 7 countries** worldwide had AI teacher training frameworks as of 2022 | UNESCO |
| **Less than half** of high school CS teachers feel equipped to teach AI | Stanford HAI, 2025 |

### What This Means

Students are using AI tools at scale. Most teachers haven't been trained. Most schools don't have clear policies. This is the definition of a gap.

## The Academic Integrity Crisis (Real Data)

### UK Universities, 2023-24 Academic Year

| Finding | Source |
|---------|--------|
| **Nearly 7,000** cases of AI-related cheating | UK Higher Education Statistics |
| **3x increase** from previous year | Same |
| **5.1 cases per 1,000 students** (triple the prior rate) | Same |

### Detection Problems

| Finding | Source |
|---------|--------|
| ChatGPT-generated exam answers went **undetected in 94% of cases** | University of Reading (Scarfe et al., 2024) |
| Those undetected answers achieved **higher grades on average** | Same study |
| **96%** of instructors believe at least some students cheated using AI | Wiley Survey, 2024 |

### Student Awareness

| Finding | Source |
|---------|--------|
| **80%** of students say using an LLM is "somewhat" or "definitely" cheating | Frontiers in Education, 2024 |
| Yet **53%** still use it for homework | Common Sense Media |
| **67%** feel they are shortcutting their learning | Turnitin, 2025 |

The gap between knowing it's wrong and doing it anyway indicates a failure of education, not character.

## College Admissions: The Real Policies

These are direct quotes from university policy statements:

### Yale University
> "Submitting the substantive content or output of an artificial intelligence platform **constitutes application fraud**."
>
> "Submitting personal statements composed by text-generating software may result in **admission revocation or expulsion**."

*Source: Yale College Undergraduate Admissions, AI Policy Statement*

### Brown University
> "The use of artificial intelligence by an applicant is **not permitted under any circumstances** in conjunction with application content."

*Source: Brown University Admissions*

### Common Application (1,000+ colleges)
> Explicitly treats **submitting AI-generated content as application fraud**.

*Source: Common Application binding agreement*

### What Colleges Allow
- Researching colleges and programs
- Brainstorming topic ideas (then developing independently)
- Grammar/spelling checks **after** writing
- Interview practice

### What Gets You Rejected
- Using AI to outline essays
- Using AI to draft any text
- Translating AI content into your own words
- Any AI-generated content in applications

Students need to know these lines exist. Most don't.

## The "8-Second Attention Span" Is False

This claim appears everywhere. It's not true.

### The Origin
In 2015, Microsoft marketing claimed humans have 8-second attention spans—less than goldfish. The BBC investigated in 2017 and found:
- The number came from "Statistic Brain," who **could not provide a credible source**
- Organizations cited (like NCBI) stated they **cannot verify the claims**
- The goldfish comparison is also false—no one knows how to measure goldfish attention

### What Real Research Shows

**Dr. Gloria Mark, UC Irvine (Longitudinal study):**
| Year | Average time on screen before switching |
|------|----------------------------------------|
| 2004 | 150 seconds (2.5 minutes) |
| 2012 | 75 seconds |
| 2021 | 47 seconds |

This measures **attention switching on screens**, not attention capacity. The same teenagers "unable to focus" binge-watch entire seasons (Netflix: 61% regularly watch 2-6 episodes consecutively) and game for hours.

### The Actual Issue
- **49%** of interruptions are self-initiated
- It takes **~25 minutes** to return to focused work after interruption
- This is about attention deployment patterns, not cognitive incapacity

### What Works (Evidence-Based)
| Strategy | Evidence |
|----------|----------|
| **8-12 minute segments** for microlearning | Meta-analysis: 0.74 SD improvement |
| **Retrieval practice** (testing yourself) | Effect size g = 0.50 (159 studies) |
| **Spaced repetition** | 2-3x higher retention rates |
| **Learning by doing** over passive listening | APA adolescent development research |

We shouldn't design for a myth. We should design for what actually works.
