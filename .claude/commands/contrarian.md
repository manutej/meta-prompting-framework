# /contrarian - Thiel-Style Epistemological Analysis

Apply contrarian thinking: What important truth do few people agree with you on?

---

## Input
$ARGUMENTS - The consensus view, market, or domain to analyze

---

## Instructions

Channel Peter Thiel's contrarian epistemology with intuitionistic rigor:

1. **Identify the Consensus**
   - What does "everyone" believe?
   - Why do they believe it?
   - Is the consensus based on proof or social agreement?

2. **Distinguish Proof from Consensus**
   - Consensus ≠ Constructive Proof
   - "Everyone believes X" provides no witness for X
   - Social proof is classically valid but intuitionistically empty

3. **Search for Secrets**
   - What non-obvious truths exist in this domain?
   - What are people afraid to say?
   - What would a constructed understanding reveal?

4. **Construct Contrarian Position**
   - Build understanding from first principles
   - Provide constructive evidence
   - The contrarian truth must have a WITNESS

5. **Output Format**
```

       CONTRARIAN ANALYSIS
═══════════════════════════════════════

THE CONSENSUS:
"[What most people believe]"
Believers: [Who holds this view]
Basis: [Why they believe - usually NOT constructive]

CONSENSUS CRITIQUE:
The consensus fails intuitionistic scrutiny because:
- [Missing witness 1]
- [Proof by authority/tradition/majority]
- [Unexamined assumptions]

THE SECRET:
"[Non-obvious truth that few believe but is provable]"

CONSTRUCTIVE EVIDENCE:
1. [Witness/evidence 1]
2. [Witness/evidence 2]
...

THIEL TEST:
Q: "What important truth do few people agree with you on?"
A: "[The contrarian position stated clearly]"

IMPLICATIONS:
If this secret is true:
→ [Implication 1]
→ [Implication 2]
→ [Opportunity/Action]

       CONTRARIAN ANALYSIS
═══════════════════════════════════════

THE CONSENSUS:
"You need a college degree to succeed in the modern economy."
Believers: Parents, guidance counselors, universities, employers
Basis: Correlation between degrees and income (NOT causation proof)

CONSENSUS CRITIQUE:
The consensus fails intuitionistic scrutiny because:
- No constructive proof that degree CAUSES success
- Confuses credentialing with competence
- Survivorship bias (we see successful grads, not successful non-grads)
- "Everyone does it" is social proof, not logical proof

THE SECRET:
"For many high-potential individuals, college is negative-value:
4 years of opportunity cost, debt, and credential-seeking
instead of building real skills and companies."

CONSTRUCTIVE EVIDENCE:
1. WITNESS: Thiel Fellows - $100K to skip college, build companies
   - Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum), Dylan Field (Figma), Austin Russell (Luminar)
2. WITNESS: Tech founders without degrees
   - Jobs, Gates, Zuckerberg, Ellison, Dell
3. WITNESS: Skills learned in 6-month bootcamp vs 4-year degree
   - Measurable competence, immediate application

THIEL TEST:
Q: "What important truth do few people agree with you on?"
A: "For ambitious builders, college is often a trap that delays
    success by 4 years while charging $200K for the privilege."

IMPLICATIONS:
If this secret is true:
→ Alternative credentialing systems will grow
→ Companies should hire based on portfolios, not degrees
→ The best talent may deliberately skip traditional education
