# /first-principles - Musk-Style Constructive Analysis

Break down a problem to first principles and construct a solution from ground truth.

---

## Input
$ARGUMENTS - The problem, claim, or assumption to deconstruct

---

## Instructions

Channel Elon Musk's first-principles thinking combined with intuitionistic logic:

1. **Identify the Conventional Wisdom**
   - What does "everyone know" about this?
   - What analogies are being used?
   - What assumptions are hiding?

2. **Decompose to Axioms**
   - What are the fundamental truths?
   - What can be measured/verified?
   - What are the actual constraints (physics, math, economics)?

3. **Reject Non-Constructive Arguments**
   - "It's always been this way" → NOT a proof
   - "Experts say it's impossible" → NOT a proof
   - "Assume it fails..." → Classical, not constructive

4. **Construct from Ground Up**
   - Build solution from verified axioms
   - Each step must be constructive
   - The construction IS the proof of possibility

5. **Output Format**
```

       FIRST PRINCIPLES ANALYSIS
═══════════════════════════════════════

CONVENTIONAL WISDOM:
"[What people assume]"

HIDDEN ASSUMPTIONS:
1. [Assumption 1] - [Why questionable]
2. [Assumption 2] - [Why questionable]
...

ACTUAL AXIOMS:
1. [Verified truth 1]
2. [Verified truth 2]
...

CONSTRUCTION:
Given axioms, we can build:
→ [Step 1: Foundation]
→ [Step 2: Build on foundation]
→ [Step 3: ...]
→ [Result: Constructed solution]

WITNESS:
[Concrete example/prototype/implementation]

MUSK VERDICT:
"[Pithy summary in Musk style]"

## Example Usage

```
/first-principles Rockets are expensive

═══════════════════════════════════════
       FIRST PRINCIPLES ANALYSIS
═══════════════════════════════════════

CONVENTIONAL WISDOM:
"Rockets cost hundreds of millions because aerospace is inherently expensive."

HIDDEN ASSUMPTIONS:
1. Rockets must be expendable - [Airplanes aren't, why rockets?]
2. Aerospace markup is necessary - [Based on cost-plus contracts]
3. Materials are expensive - [Never actually checked]

ACTUAL AXIOMS:
1. Rocket materials (Al, Ti, Cu, C-fiber) = ~2% of rocket cost
2. Physics allows vertical landing (sufficient fuel margin)
3. Manufacturing can be vertically integrated

CONSTRUCTION:
Given axioms, we can build:
→ In-house manufacturing (remove supply chain markup)
→ Reusable first stage (amortize over many flights)
→ Mass production (reduce per-unit cost)
→ Result: $2,720/kg to orbit (vs $54,500/kg Space Shuttle)

WITNESS:
Falcon 9 Block 5 - landed and reflown 19+ times
Starship - fully reusable architecture

MUSK VERDICT:
"The best part is no part. The best process is no process.
 Rockets WERE expensive. We constructed the proof they don't have to be."
