## 🎓 Learning Philosophy

### The Pioneer Approach

```
❌ Traditional Learning          ✅ Pioneer Learning
───────────────────────         ─────────────────────
Theory first                    Practice → Theory → Practice
Slow feedback                   24-hour iteration
Perfect understanding           Ship and iterate
One path                        Multiple experiments
Solo learning                   Teaching while learning
Linear growth                   Compound growth (37x/year)
```

### Key Principles

1. **First Principles Thinking**
   - Break problems to fundamental truths
   - Rebuild from foundation up
   - Question every assumption

2. **Compound Learning**
   - 1% daily improvement = 37x in one year
   - Small consistent gains compound
   - Track and celebrate progress

3. **Teaching Pyramid**
   - 10% retention from reading
   - 90% retention from teaching
   - Build in public, help others

4. **Second-Order Thinking**
   - Consider consequences of consequences
   - Think in systems, not events
   - Anticipate emergent behavior

5. **Quality Gradient**
   - Research: Perfect accuracy required
   - Production: Good enough to ship
   - Match effort to context
