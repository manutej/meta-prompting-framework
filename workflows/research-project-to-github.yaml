description: |
  Complete meta-workflow for transforming research materials into a production-ready
  GitHub repository with documentation, infrastructure, and deployment.

  This workflow encapsulates the entire process of:
  1. Analyzing research materials and identifying key components
  2. Creating proper repository structure
  3. Adding agents, commands, workflows, and skills
  4. Generating comprehensive documentation
  5. Initializing git and pushing to GitHub
  6. Creating integration guides and use case documentation

  Use this for: Research papers → Public repos, Internal projects → Open source,
  Frameworks → Distributable packages, Documentation → Shareable resources

         - Programming languages/runtime needed?
         - Dependencies and prerequisites?
         - Build/deployment systems?
         - Testing frameworks?

      3. Documentation Structure
         - What needs explanation?
         - What examples are required?
         - What integration guides?
         - What use cases to highlight?

      4. Target Audience
         - Who will use this?
         - What's their expertise level?
         - What documentation do they need?
