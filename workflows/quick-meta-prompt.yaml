name: Quick Meta-Prompt Application
description: |
  Fast workflow for applying production meta-prompts from V2 library to any task.
  Analyzes complexity, selects optimal meta-prompt, and delivers enhanced output.

agents:
  - meta-agent (via command)

steps:
  - name: complexity_analysis
    description: Analyze task complexity and requirements
    inputs:
      - task_description
    outputs:
      - complexity_score
      - domain_type
      - constraints
      - meta_prompt_recommendation
    prompt: |
      Analyze this task to select optimal meta-prompt:

      TASK: ${task_description}

      Determine:
      1. Complexity (0.0-1.0): How hard is this?
      2. Domain: code? creative? analysis? research? data?
      3. Constraints: speed? quality? clarity? formality?
      4. Format: structured? freeform? mixed?

      SELECTION CRITERIA:
      - Complexity < 0.3: Simple/direct approach
      - Complexity 0.3-0.7: Balanced synthesis
      - Complexity > 0.7: Full autonomous evolution

      Recommend meta-prompt from V2 library:
      - Autonomous Routing (default, always works)
      - Principle-Centered (novel problems, 92% quality)
      - Domain-Bridge (cross-domain, 88% quality)
      - Quality-Focused (high-stakes, 89% quality)
      - Emergent Properties (breakthrough, 86% quality)
      - Cost-Balanced (speed-critical, 82% quality)
